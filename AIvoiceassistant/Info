College Curriculum Voice Assistant

This project integrates a voice assistant with your college curriculum, enabling voice interaction to access curriculum-related information from PDFs.

 Features

- Voice recognition using Google Speech Recognition API.
- Text extraction from PDF documents.
- Context-aware responses via the Gemini API.
- Text-to-speech for verbal responses.

 How It Works

1. The assistant listens to voice commands and converts them to text.
2. It extracts relevant content from the specified PDF.
3. The extracted text and query are sent to the Gemini API for a response.
4. The response is read aloud using text-to-speech.
